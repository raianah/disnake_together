@client.command()
async def youtubeTogether(self, ctx):
    togetherControl = DiscordTogether(self.client)
    # To check if the user is in a vc
    try:
        vc = ctx.author.voice.channel.id

    except:
        await ctx.channel.send("You are not in a VC, please join one and then use the command")
